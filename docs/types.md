# Types

## Strict types ensures quality

**I’m strict about types because:**

- ✅ Types help us code faster.
- ✅ Types help us read faster.
- ✅ Types help us catch mistakes earlier.
- ✅ Types help us assure the app works.

## Types saves times

In TypeScript, declaring types saves me more time than it costs me:

- ✅ Speeds up my reading.
- ✅ Catches my errors earlier.
- ✅ Clarifies my mental model.
- ✅ Gives me robust, reliable autocomplete.
- ✅ Avoids me spending time checking docs.
- ✅ Helps me understand my own code later.
- ✅ Reduces the number of tests I need to write.
- ✅ Helps my editor reliably auto-import so I don't have to write imports myself.
- ✅ Gives me the confidence and safety to be able to make large-scale, type-safe refactors.
- ✅ Helps other people understand my code, which speeds up code reviews, reduces the risk of bugs, and accelerates future code changes.

So types don’t just help ensure quality. They save me time
