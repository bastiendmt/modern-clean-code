# Fetching data

## Fetching data in React

Problem: Fetching in useEffect is clunky, verbose, and error prone.

Solution: Use one of these instead:

1. React Server Components
2. Tanstack Query
3. Tanstack Router loaders
4. React Router loaders
5. Remix loaders
6. RTK Query
7. Apollo
8. swr

Certains meta-frameworks like Next.js have built-in support for fetching data.

More details on [acticles](./articles.md) which explains why fetching data with useEffect is generally a bad idea.
