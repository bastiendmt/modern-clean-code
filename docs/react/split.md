# Split components

Signs we should split a component:

ğŸš© The props are complicated and confusing

ğŸš© We need different combinations of props for different use cases

ğŸš© There is a large number of optional props

ğŸš© The API allows "illogical" prop combinations

ğŸš© The component is expensive to render
