# Warnings

## Do not ignore warnings

If we start allowing some warnings, errors, or broken tests, **it creates a slippery slope**.

I’ve seen teams with 100’s of ignored warnings, and dozens of ignored broken tests. It started with just a few, then they slowly became blind to the growing problem.

Plus, existing warnings and broken tests mask new issues, so **new problems just pile up**.
