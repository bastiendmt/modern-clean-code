# Quality

## Code owner

**Problem**: Ideally, everyone is responsible for quality. But, if everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.

**Solution**: Establish a code owner.

This person is officially responsible for code quality. This could be the team lead, or a senior developer.

**Whatâ€™s a code owner do to ensure quality?**

- Pair program.
- Review code.
- Foster reuse.
- Coach others.
- Update dependencies.
- Remove needless complexity.
- Help make key technical decisions.
- Find and resolve security, accessibility, performance issues.

The code owner is given flexibility in their daily schedule to perform these tasks.

Again, ideally everyone does these things. But a code owner assures all this happens because _it's their job_.
